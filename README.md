# Customer-Churn-analysis

This project gives an overview on a "Customer Churn Analysis" Dashboard I developed during the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program.


## Project Overview:
Few weeks after presenting a customer call centre dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reached out. He was impressed by my work and asked if I can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

The telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner where he addressed the following painpoints: 
1. Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned and he did not want to lose them
2. The retention department was to to get customers back in case of termination 
3. Currently, they get in touch after customers have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
4. They have done customer analysis with Excel: it always ended in a dead-end
5. The organizatiom would like to know more about their customers: visualised clearly so that itâ€™s self-explanatory for the management.

   Additinally, the retention manager emailed some inputs the organization would appreciate

## Key Insights from Dashboard:

- Identified a churn rate of approximately 26.54%, emphasizing the need for robust customer retention strategies.
- Factors influencing churn include customer tenure, contract type, and service preferences.
- Notable trends observed in demographics, service usage, and churn behavior.

### Customer Retention Analysis:

- Senior citizens represent 25% of customers, with a balanced gender distribution.
- Out of 7,043 customers, 1,869 churned, resulting in a revenue loss of $2.86M.
- Fiber Optic internet service contributed significantly to revenue but exhibited a high churn rate.

### Customer Demographics & Service Information:

- Majority of customers are subscribed to phone services, indicating a strong reliance on communication.
- Concerns about online security are evident among customers, highlighting the importance of addressing cybersecurity measures.
- Fiber Optic emerged as the most popular internet service, while Electronic Checks were the preferred payment method.
- Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibited higher churn rates compared to those on longer-term contracts, possibly due to flexibility or dissatisfaction.

## Factors Influencing Churn:

- Key factors contributing to churn include customer age, tenure, contract type, and service subscriptions.
- Month-to-month contracts and high charges were associated with higher churn rates, suggesting the need for competitive pricing strategies or longer contract durations.
- Fiber Optic internet service and the absence of additional services like Tech Support and Device Protection were significant contributors to churn, indicating areas for improvement in service offerings.
